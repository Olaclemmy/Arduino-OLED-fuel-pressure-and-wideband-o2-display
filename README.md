# Arduino-OLED-fuel-pressure-and-wideband-o2-display
This is an arduino display for 0-5volt inputs from a fuel pressure transducer, and innovate lc1 using SSD1306 displays


This is using an ebay fuel pressure transducer with a 5v input and a 0-4.5v output.
It's also using an innovate lc1's 0-5v analong output.
This can be converted to to other sensors and scaling values pretty easily changing the math under the wideband
and fuel pressure functions.
